# Summary (short)

- Created short reports covering: Performance, Security, Optimization, Bugs, and Testing.
- High-impact quick wins: enable compression, add caching, lazy-load JSON, add dependency manifests, and add basic tests + CI.
- Next suggested step: pick one quick win (e.g., enable gzip and add `requirements.txt`/`package.json`) and I can implement or provide exact patch instructions.
